--> I'm Working on Project 9. How Do I Compile My .jack Files?

    Unlike the simulators, which feature an interactive user interface, the Jack Compiler is a terminal-oriented application. In order to run it, you must supply the name of the file or folder that you wish to compile. For example, suppose you wish to compile all .jack files stored in the folder projects/09/Square (that's a folder called Square, located in the 09 folder, which is located in the projects folder). To do so, open a Terminal window and type:

    JackCompiler.sh ~/Desktop/nand2tetris/projects/09/Square

    This results in either a successful compilation of the .jack files in Square, or some compilation errors.
